# Exercise 10 - Fibonacci

Create a function that returns a specific member of the Fibonacci sequence:

> A series of numbers in which each number ( Fibonacci number ) is the sum of the two preceding numbers. The simplest is the series 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, etc.

```javascript
fibonacci(4) // returns the 4th member of the series: 3  (1, 1, 2, 3)
fibonacci(6) // returns 8
```


# solution 
- init = 0
- start = 1 
- current + previous = 0 + 1 = 1
- current + previous = 1 + 1 = 2
- current + previous = 2 + 1 = 3
- current + previous = 3 + 2 = 5
- current + previous = 5 + 3 = 8
